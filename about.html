                        The Secrets of our Successful Sports Club
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        It is no secret that without good coaches, players will have a very difficult time
                         developing and improving their skills in the game. The real secret is that there are
                          two key components of the quality of coaching in a club.Behind the scenes, there is
                           the coaching support system. This is comprised of the club’s coaching recruitment 
                           and retention system, coaching leadership (often in the person of a technical director
                            or director of coaching), professional development and coaching education opportunities,
                            and administrative support for coaches at both the club and team levels.<br><br><br><br>
                             The club’s player development philosophy and training curriculum are also a part of
                              this system.The coaching skills and knowledge working with players tend to receive 
                              more attention and scrutiny. One of the most important criteria a player family uses
                               for selecting a club is the quality of the coach for whom its child will play.Whether
                                volunteers or paid staff, coaches spend a significant amount of time off the field
                                 preparing for training sessions and games, as well as their own self-improvement.<br><br><br><br>
                                  Much of this effort is invisible to players and their families even though it 
                                  contributes significantly to the quality of the player experience.Governance and
                                   LeadershipA great many clubs are non-profit organizations lead by boards of directors
                                    made up of parent volunteers. This means that the leadership of clubs is made up of
                                     people who deeply care for the success of the organization. It also provides the 
                                     challenge for parents to separate their natural advocacy for their individual<br><br><br><br>
                                      children from their legal and fiduciary responsibilities to the organization 
                                      as officers and leaders of the organization.The most effective organizations 
                                      have clear roles and areas of responsibility for their board members. This enables
                                       them to focus on organization budgeting and funding, policy development, setting 
                                       program priorities and direction, and delegating activities and program implementation
                                        to others. Clubs may have a mix of professionally paid staff and volunteers (including
                                         coaches) to deliver the club programs, but it is important for board members to resist
                                          the temptation to micro-manage club activities. Engaging a broader spectrum of staff and 
                                          volunteers not only spreads out the work, it also invites more people to become
                                           invested and supportive of the club.
